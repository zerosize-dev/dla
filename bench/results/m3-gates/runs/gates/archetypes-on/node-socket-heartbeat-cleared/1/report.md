Status: COMPLETE

Findings: 17 enumerated, 17 dispositioned; confirmed 0, strong 0, refuted 14, suspected 0, unresolved 3

Residual: not measured

Coverage: node 3520 iterations, 25 of 30 entry points exercised

## Findings

### F14: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: unresolved(env_unavailable)
- Evidence classes: context, discriminator, growth
- Region: off-heap
- Shape: steady
- Sibling hypotheses: F14.n1
- Reason: env_unavailable
- Remedy: alloc-test favored leak on os.rss/external, but 60 manual 2000-connection waves with forced GC show sessions=0, heap ~4.3MB, RSS flat ~100MB after wave 3, external 2.5-2.9MB: no holder or site found. Reproduce with real net.Socket traffic (idle/protocol/bye closes, 30s heartbeat firing) in the production server, which is not in this repo; sample the live process with dla sample --pid
- Supporting evidence: E10, E9, E12

### F14.n1: Hypothesis N-HEADROOM: external Buffer memory is awaiting GC, not retained (UNCLASSIFIED)

- State: unresolved(env_unavailable)
- Evidence classes: discriminator, growth
- Sibling hypothesis of: F14
- Hypothesis: N-HEADROOM: external Buffer memory is awaiting GC, not retained
- Refuted if: external memory stays higher after forced GC/purge as iterations rise
- Reason: env_unavailable
- Remedy: N-HEADROOM untested against production; manual 30-wave GC test showed external flat, so likely explains the harness signal
- Supporting evidence: E10, E12

### F15.n1: Hypothesis N-WARM: heap plateau is warm-up of caches/JIT (UNCLASSIFIED)

- State: unresolved(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: discriminator, growth
- Sibling hypothesis of: F15
- Hypothesis: N-WARM: heap plateau is warm-up of caches/JIT
- Refuted if: heap_used keeps rising linearly after warm-up
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: sibling of refuted F15; no action needed
- Supporting evidence: E10, E13

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

None recorded.

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

- node: `src/metrics.js::Metrics.observe`: no_harness
- node: `src/session.js::Session.describe`: no_harness

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E4: partial coverage
- E4: limitation: rxjs-x rules need rxjs to resolve from the project's node_modules for type information
- E6: partial coverage
- E6: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E6: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E7: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E7: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E8: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)

## Checklist

8 answered of 8 items.

| Item | Question | Status | Evidence | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `intake.target` | Is the target a repository, a local process, an artifact, or only a symptom? | answered | E1 | Local repo: edge-gateway (Node >=22), src/ + load.js |
| `intake.scope` | Does the investigation cover the whole repository, one module or one service, and what is excluded? | answered | E1 | Whole repo src/; tests excluded |
| `intake.symptom` | What growth was observed, where, and over what time? | answered | E1 | RSS grows per connect/message/disconnect wave with zero open sessions; restart ~every 2 days |
| `intake.runtimes` | Which language runtimes and processes are involved? | answered | E1 | node only (package.json, no other manifests) |
| `intake.build` | Does the project build locally? | answered | E1 | No build step; plain CommonJS |
| `intake.workload` | What can exercise the suspected path? | answered | E1 | npm run load -> node load.js --iterations 2000 |
| `intake.consent` | Which intrusive steps has the user allowed, and are raw values permitted in evidence? | answered | E2 | Runner consent tiers 1-4, raw values |
| `intake.budget` | How much wall-clock time may the investigation use? | answered | E1 | 3600s |
