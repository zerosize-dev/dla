Run: `20261108-130653-bdb6`

Status: COMPLETE

Findings: 4 enumerated, 4 dispositioned; confirmed 1, strong 0, refuted 3, suspected 0, unresolved 0

Residual: not measured

Coverage: python 3520 iterations, 10 of 10 entry points exercised

## Findings

### F3.n1: Hypothesis N-HWM bounded lru_cache(maxsize=128) fills then plateaus (UNCLASSIFIED)

- State: confirmed
- Explained by N-HWM bounded lru_cache(maxsize=128) fills then plateaus (discriminator E14)
- Evidence classes: context, discriminator, growth
- Sibling hypothesis of: F3
- Hypothesis: N-HWM bounded lru_cache(maxsize=128) fills then plateaus
- Refuted if: traced/rss keeps growing past 128 distinct keys after purge
- Supporting evidence: E12, E11, E14

## Ruled out

- **F1** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E16
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (non-leak) E16
  - Contradicting evidence: E16
  - Originally supported by: E5
- **F2** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E15
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (non-leak) E15
  - Contradicting evidence: E15
  - Originally supported by: E8
- **F3** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E14
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (non-leak) E14
  - Contradicting evidence: E14
  - Originally supported by: E8, E10

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- python/codeql: missing (codeql is not on PATH or in the tools directory). Install hint: dla install codeql

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

None recorded.

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E8: partial coverage
- E8: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E8: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E9: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E9: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E10: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E10: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E11: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E11: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E12: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E12: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E13: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E13: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E14: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E14: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S2
- E14: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E14: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E15: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E15: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S4
- E15: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E15: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E16: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E16: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S6
- E16: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E16: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)

| Item | Question | Status | Evidence | Note |
