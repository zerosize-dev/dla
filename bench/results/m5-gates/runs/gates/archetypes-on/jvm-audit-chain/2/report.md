## Findings

### F6: **Novel mechanism (UNCLASSIFIED)**

- State: confirmed
- Growth: `probe:gateway.RequestContext.latest` 3 count/n (steady, gate pass, E11)
- Evidence classes: context, discriminator, growth, static
- Holder: static/global
- Owner: `gateway.RequestContext.latest`
- Region: heap
- Shape: steady
- Site: `src/gateway/RequestContext.java:5`
- Writers: `src/gateway/RequestContext.java:28`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Annotation: RequestContext.open links each new context to the previous one (previous field) and stores it in static 'latest'; nothing ever clears the link, so every request's context (with its 384-byte body, caller, path) stays reachable from the static root as an unbounded chain. previous is only used to read previousPath and microsSincePrevious. Missing pairing: the back-reference should be reduced to the two needed values (previous path, previous arrival time) instead of retaining the whole predecessor.
- Sibling hypotheses: F6.n1
- Supporting evidence: E6, E9, E11, E12

### F1: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: growth, static
- Site: `src/gateway/RequestContext.java:28`
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Same chain as confirmed F6 (previous link/body of contexts retained from static latest); no separate probe; fixing F6's retention resolves it
- Supporting evidence: E5, E11

### F2: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(no_harness)
- Evidence classes: growth, static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `gateway.Gateway.routes`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/gateway/Gateway.java:9`
- Writers: `src/gateway/Gateway.java:14`, `src/gateway/Gateway.java:15`, `src/gateway/Gateway.java:16`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: no_harness
- Remedy: No probe or growing column for this holder in H1; bounded by design (fixed routes, 64 accounts, 20-line history); add a driver probe to rule out
- Supporting evidence: E6, E10

### F3: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(no_harness)
- Evidence classes: growth, static
- Holder: closure/continuation
- Owner: `gateway.Gateway.auditSink`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/gateway/Gateway.java:10`
- Writers: `src/gateway/Gateway.java:17`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: no_harness
- Remedy: No probe or growing column for this holder in H1; bounded by design (fixed routes, 64 accounts, 20-line history); add a driver probe to rule out
- Supporting evidence: E6, E10

### F4: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(no_harness)
- Evidence classes: growth, static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `gateway.Ledger.balances`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/gateway/Ledger.java:12`
- Writers: `src/gateway/Ledger.java:18`, `src/gateway/Ledger.java:36`, `src/gateway/Ledger.java:37`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: no_harness
- Remedy: No probe or growing column for this holder in H1; bounded by design (fixed routes, 64 accounts, 20-line history); add a driver probe to rule out
- Supporting evidence: E6, E10

### F5: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(no_harness)
- Evidence classes: growth, static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `gateway.Ledger.history`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/gateway/Ledger.java:13`
- Writers: `src/gateway/Ledger.java:19`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: no_harness
- Remedy: No probe or growing column for this holder in H1; bounded by design (fixed routes, 64 accounts, 20-line history); add a driver probe to rule out
- Supporting evidence: E6, E10

### F7: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: growth, static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `gateway.RequestContext.body`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/gateway/RequestContext.java:11`
- Writers: `src/gateway/RequestContext.java:20`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Same chain as confirmed F6 (previous link/body of contexts retained from static latest); no separate probe; fixing F6's retention resolves it
- Supporting evidence: E6, E11

### F8: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: growth, static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `gateway.RequestContext.previous`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/gateway/RequestContext.java:13`
- Writers: `src/gateway/RequestContext.java:22`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Same chain as confirmed F6 (previous link/body of contexts retained from static latest); no separate probe; fixing F6's retention resolves it
- Supporting evidence: E6, E11

## Ruled out

- **F6.n1** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E12
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (leak) E12
  - Hypothesis: N-WARM: growth is a warm-up fill that plateaus
  - Refuted if: growth continues over the extra cycles
  - Contradicting evidence: E12
  - Originally supported by: E11

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- jvm/bcc-memleak: blocked (bcc memleak is not driven by DLA in this version; `dla attach bpftrace` counts mapped bytes per call stack (tier 3, root))
- jvm/codeql: missing (codeql is not on PATH or in the tools directory). Install hint: dla install codeql
- jvm/errorprone: missing (Error Prone jars not found in the tools directory (or DLA_ERRORPRONE_HOME)). Install hint: dla install errorprone
- jvm/gpu-nvml: blocked (GPU memory (NVML, nvidia-smi) is not read by DLA in this version: device memory growth is a blind spot)
- jvm/sonar: missing (sonar-scanner is not installed and Sonar rules need a SonarQube or SonarCloud server). Install hint: install sonar-scanner, run a SonarQube or SonarCloud server and set SONAR_HOST_URL and SONAR_TOKEN (dla install sonar prints the steps)
- jvm/valgrind: blocked (Valgrind is not run on the JVM: the virtual machine's own allocations drown the project's; use the allocator shim, jcmd NMT or `dla attach bpftrace`)

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

None recorded.

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E4: partial coverage
- E4: limitation: no auxiliary classpath: library calls are not modelled
- E6: partial coverage
- E6: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E6: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E7: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E7: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E8: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E8: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E8: limitation: note: the build script compiles and runs the unit tests again at every point; the measured program is the last JVM it starts
- E9: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E9: limitation: jvm probe bytes are a shallow estimate assuming compressed oops
- E9: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E10: limitation: jvm probe bytes are a shallow estimate assuming compressed oops
- E10: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E10: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E11: limitation: jvm probe bytes are a shallow estimate assuming compressed oops
- E11: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E11: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E12: limitation: jvm probe bytes are a shallow estimate assuming compressed oops
- E12: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E12: limitation: jvm probe bytes are a shallow estimate assuming compressed oops
- E12: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E12: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S2
- E12: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E12: limitation: note: the build script compiles and runs the unit tests again at every point; the measured program is the last JVM it starts
- E12: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
