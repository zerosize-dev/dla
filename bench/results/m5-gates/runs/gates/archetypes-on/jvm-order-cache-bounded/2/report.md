## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- jvm/bcc-memleak: blocked (bcc memleak is not driven by DLA in this version; `dla attach bpftrace` counts mapped bytes per call stack (tier 3, root))
- jvm/codeql: missing (codeql is not on PATH or in the tools directory). Install hint: dla install codeql
- jvm/errorprone: missing (Error Prone jars not found in the tools directory (or DLA_ERRORPRONE_HOME)). Install hint: dla install errorprone
- jvm/gpu-nvml: blocked (GPU memory (NVML, nvidia-smi) is not read by DLA in this version: device memory growth is a blind spot)
- jvm/sonar: missing (sonar-scanner is not installed and Sonar rules need a SonarQube or SonarCloud server). Install hint: install sonar-scanner, run a SonarQube or SonarCloud server and set SONAR_HOST_URL and SONAR_TOKEN (dla install sonar prints the steps)
- jvm/valgrind: blocked (Valgrind is not run on the JVM: the virtual machine's own allocations drown the project's; use the allocator shim, jcmd NMT or `dla attach bpftrace`)

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

None recorded.

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E4: partial coverage
- E4: limitation: no auxiliary classpath: library calls are not modelled
- E6: partial coverage
- E6: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E6: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E7: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E7: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E8: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E8: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E8: limitation: note: the build script compiles and runs the unit tests again at every point; the measured program is the last JVM it starts
- E9: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E9: limitation: command-mode heap dumps come from separate processes: dla summarize heap-graph compares dumps of one process only, so use a driver (dla harness gen --driver) for a dump series
- E9: limitation: jvm probe bytes are a shallow estimate assuming compressed oops
- E9: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E10: limitation: jvm probe bytes are a shallow estimate assuming compressed oops
- E10: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
