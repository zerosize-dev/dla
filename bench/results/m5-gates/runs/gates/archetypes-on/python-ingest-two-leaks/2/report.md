## Findings

### F3: **Novel mechanism (UNCLASSIFIED)**

- State: confirmed
- Growth: `probe:ingest.parser._newest.bytes` 655.5 bytes/n (steady, gate pass, E11)
- Evidence classes: context, discriminator, growth, static
- Holder: static/global
- Owner: `ingest.parser._newest`
- Region: heap
- Shape: steady
- Site: `ingest/parser.py:3`
- Writers: `ingest/parser.py:29`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Annotation: parser._newest module global; each Record.previous links to the prior Record, so every Record ever parsed stays reachable via the chain (and its tags/strings). Missing pairing: previous link never dropped/ bounded.
- Sibling hypotheses: F3.n1
- Supporting evidence: E7, E10, E11, E14, E15

### F6: **Novel mechanism (UNCLASSIFIED)**

- State: confirmed
- Growth: `probe:ingest.registry._LISTENERS.bytes` 1906 bytes/n (steady, gate pass, E11)
- Evidence classes: context, discriminator, growth, static
- Holder: registration-table
- Owner: `ingest.registry._LISTENERS`
- Region: heap
- Shape: steady
- Site: `ingest/registry.py:3`
- Writers: `ingest/registry.py:7`, `ingest/pipeline.py:28`
- Removers: `ingest/registry.py:24`, `ingest/registry.py:25`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Annotation: Pipeline.process_batch subscribes a new CheckpointWatcher per batch to registry._LISTENERS['checkpoint']; nothing unsubscribes (reset() is test-only). Each watcher holds marks dict of all known sensors (watchers.py:8).
- Sibling hypotheses: F6.n1
- Supporting evidence: E7, E10, E11, E14, E16

### F1: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Site: `ingest/parser.py:29`
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Detector hit at the same site as confirmed F3 (parser._newest chain); covered by F3, no separate confirmation needed
- Supporting evidence: E6, E7

### F2: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Site: `ingest/registry.py:3`
- Suggested archetype (unconfirmed): L-COLLECT
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Detector hit at the same holder as confirmed F6 (registry._LISTENERS); covered by F6
- Supporting evidence: E6, E7

### F4: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `ingest.pipeline.Pipeline.per_sensor`
- Region: heap
- Site: `ingest/pipeline.py:15`
- Writers: `ingest/pipeline.py:25`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: per_sensor is keyed by 64 fixed sensor ids so bounded by design; no probe column grew (only whole-process growth, not tied). Re-check only if sensor id cardinality is unbounded in production
- Supporting evidence: E7

### F5: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: registration-table
- Owner: `ingest.pipeline.Pipeline.process_batch`
- Region: heap
- Site: `ingest/pipeline.py:28`
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Subscription call site feeding confirmed F6; covered by F6. Fix class: unsubscribe/deregister the watcher after its checkpoint
- Supporting evidence: E7

## Ruled out

- **F3.n1** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E15
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (leak) E15
  - Hypothesis: N-WARM: warm-up fill that plateaus
  - Refuted if: growth continues over the extra cycles
  - Contradicting evidence: E15
  - Originally supported by: E12
- **F6.n1** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E16
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (leak) E16
  - Hypothesis: N-WARM: warm-up fill that plateaus
  - Refuted if: growth continues over the extra cycles
  - Contradicting evidence: E16
  - Originally supported by: E12

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- python/bcc-memleak: blocked (bcc memleak is not driven by DLA in this version; `dla attach bpftrace` counts mapped bytes per call stack (tier 3, root))
- python/codeql: missing (codeql is not on PATH or in the tools directory). Install hint: dla install codeql
- python/gpu-nvml: blocked (GPU memory (NVML, nvidia-smi) is not read by DLA in this version: device memory growth is a blind spot)
- python/memray: missing (memray is not installed in the target's python interpreter, so --capture alloc has the tracemalloc report only). Install hint: pip install memray in the interpreter the workload runs under, then dla harness run <H> --capture alloc

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

None recorded.

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E7: partial coverage
- E7: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E7: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E8: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E8: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E9: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E9: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E10: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E10: limitation: p1-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
