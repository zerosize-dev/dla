# DLA report

Run: `20261109-203952-2dd7`

Status: COMPLETE

Entry: repository

Scope: repository; excluded: none; out of scope: none

Findings: 2 enumerated, 2 dispositioned; confirmed 1, strong 0, refuted 1, suspected 0, unresolved 0

Residual: not measured

Coverage: python 3520 iterations, 13 of 13 entry points exercised

## Findings

### F1.n1: Hypothesis N-HEADROOM: registry nodes are cyclic garbage reclaimed late because gc gen0 threshold is 40000 (UNCLASSIFIED)

- State: confirmed
- Explained by N-HEADROOM (discriminator E14)
- Evidence classes: context, discriminator, growth
- Sibling hypothesis of: F1
- Hypothesis: N-HEADROOM: registry nodes are cyclic garbage reclaimed late because gc gen0 threshold is 40000
- Refuted if: post-gc live objects/traced bytes grow with n
- Supporting evidence: E12, E11, E14

## Ruled out

- **F1** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E14
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (non-leak) E14
  - Contradicting evidence: E14
  - Originally supported by: E8

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- python/bcc-memleak: blocked (bcc memleak is not driven by DLA in this version; `dla attach bpftrace` counts mapped bytes per call stack (tier 3, root))
- python/codeql: missing (codeql is not on PATH or in the tools directory). Install hint: dla install codeql
- python/gpu-nvml: blocked (GPU memory (NVML, nvidia-smi) is not read by DLA in this version: device memory growth is a blind spot)
- python/memray: missing (memray is not installed in the target's python interpreter, so --capture alloc has the tracemalloc report only). Install hint: pip install memray in the interpreter the workload runs under, then dla harness run <H> --capture alloc

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

None recorded.

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E8: partial coverage
- E8: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E8: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E9: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E9: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E10: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E10: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E11: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E11: limitation: p1-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E11: limitation: p4-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E11: limitation: p6-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E11: limitation: p9-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E11: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E12: limitation: p1-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E12: limitation: p4-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E12: limitation: p6-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E12: limitation: p9-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E12: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E12: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E13: limitation: p1-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E13: limitation: p4-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E13: limitation: p6-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E13: limitation: p9-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E13: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E13: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E14: limitation: p1-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E14: limitation: p4-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E14: limitation: p6-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E14: limitation: p9-native: alloc capture failed: memray is not installed in this interpreter (/usr/local/bin/python3); pip install memray there to add its live-at-exit report
- E14: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E14: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S2
- E14: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E14: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
