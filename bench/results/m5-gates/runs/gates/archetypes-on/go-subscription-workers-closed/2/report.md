## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- go/bcc-memleak: blocked (bcc memleak is not driven by DLA in this version; `dla attach bpftrace` counts mapped bytes per call stack (tier 3, root))
- go/goroutineleak: blocked (the goroutineleak profile needs Go 1.27 or newer (go1.24.7 here) and GOTOOLCHAIN=local forbids switching to go1.27.0)
- go/gpu-nvml: blocked (GPU memory (NVML, nvidia-smi) is not read by DLA in this version: device memory growth is a blind spot)

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

- go: `internal/notify/hub.go::Hub.Opened`: no_harness
- go: `internal/workload/workload.go::NewRNG`: no_harness

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E8: partial coverage
- E8: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E8: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E9: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E9: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E10: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E10: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E10: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E11: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E11: limitation: goroutineleak: blocked (the goroutineleak profile needs Go 1.27 or newer (go1.24.7 here) and GOTOOLCHAIN=local forbids switching to go1.27.0)
- E11: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E12: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E12: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E13: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E13: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E14: limitation: goroutines are grouped by the `created by` frame: a group ties to a finding only when that go statement is the finding's site or a recorded writer
- E14: limitation: goroutines without a creator (main, runtime) are not grouped; wait reasons and totals never tie
- E15: limitation: goroutines are grouped by the `created by` frame: a group ties to a finding only when that go statement is the finding's site or a recorded writer
- E15: limitation: goroutines without a creator (main, runtime) are not grouped; wait reasons and totals never tie
- E15: limitation: capture-series rule: at least 3 captures, every figure strictly increasing across every pair, last interval at least 50% of the first (provisional, not calibrated)
- E16: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E16: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S3
- E16: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E16: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E16: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E17: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E17: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S5
- E17: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E17: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E17: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E18: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E18: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S7
- E18: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E18: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E18: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
