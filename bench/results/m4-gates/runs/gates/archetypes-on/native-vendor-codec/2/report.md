## Findings

### F4: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(build_fails)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `src.ring.ring_put.items`
- Region: off-heap
- Site: `src/ring.c:34`
- Writers: `src/ring.c:17`
- Removers: `src/ring.c:28`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Annotation: Likely mechanism (static, unproven): ring_put overwrites the oldest pointer after 32 slots and the ring never looks inside items, so evicted vendor frames handed to on_frame are never released; main.c also never releases them. Whether acme_frame is owned by the app depends on the missing vendor header.
- Reason: build_fails
- Remedy: Install libacmecodec + header, check whether on_frame frames are caller-owned (release API), then dla harness gen/run/alloc-test --lang native
- Supporting evidence: E5

### F1: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: unresolved(build_fails)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `src.ring.ring.items`
- Region: off-heap
- Site: `src/ring.c:6`
- Writers: `src/ring.c:17`, `src/ring.c:34`
- Removers: `src/ring.c:28`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: build_fails
- Remedy: Vendor library absent; build and run harness once libacmecodec is installed. Static read: no growth in this holder itself (fixed-size ring/sink).
- Supporting evidence: E5

- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: build_fails
- Remedy: Vendor library absent; build and run harness once libacmecodec is installed. Static read: no growth in this holder itself (fixed-size ring/sink).
