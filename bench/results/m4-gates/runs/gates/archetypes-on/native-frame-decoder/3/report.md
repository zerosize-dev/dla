## Findings

### F1: **Novel mechanism (UNCLASSIFIED)**

- State: confirmed
- Growth: `native.live_blocks@src/decoder.c:29` 0.0625 count/n (steady, gate pass, E10)
- Evidence classes: context, growth, static
- Holder: native-handle/global-ref
- Owner: `decode_frame local buf (malloc at decoder.c:29)`
- Region: heap
- Shape: steady
- Site: `src/decoder.c:29`
- Writers: `src/decoder.c:29`
- Annotation: decode_frame mallocs buf (decoder.c:29). The FRAME_ERR_CHECKSUM return (decoder.c:44) does not free(buf), unlike the rle_expand failure path (decoder.c:34), and out->pixels is not set, so the caller has no pointer. Each damaged frame (1 in 16 in the workload; slope 0.0625 blocks/frame) leaks up to 64 KiB. Missing pairing: release of buf on the checksum-failure path. Repair class: free the buffer on every error return after allocation. Archetype left UNCLASSIFIED.
- Sibling hypotheses: F1.n1
- Suggested archetype (unconfirmed): L-OWNERSHIP
- Supporting evidence: E4, E8, E10

### F2: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: static/global
- Owner: `src.checksum.table`
- Region: off-heap
- Site: `src/checksum.c:3`
- Writers: `src/checksum.c:12`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: static CRC table is a fixed-size lookup; no growing column was tied to it. Confirm with an unbound alloc-test if desired.
- Supporting evidence: E5

### F3: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: native-handle/global-ref
- Owner: `src.decoder.decode_frame`
- Region: off-heap
- Site: `src/decoder.c:29`
- Removers: `src/decoder.c:34`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: same allocation site as confirmed F1 (decoder.c:29); the growth is explained by F1, no separate evidence
- Supporting evidence: E5

### F4: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `src.frame.decoded_frame.pixels`
- Region: off-heap
- Site: `src/frame.h:39`
- Writers: `src/decoder.c:44`
- Removers: `src/decoder.c:51`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: decoded_frame.pixels is released by frame_release on the success path; the leak is the failure path in F1. No separate growth column.
- Supporting evidence: E5

### F5: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: native-handle/global-ref
- Owner: `src.main.main`
- Region: off-heap
- Site: `src/main.c:33`
- Removers: `src/main.c:60`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: main's wire buffer is a single allocation freed at exit; no growth column tied to it
- Supporting evidence: E5

## Ruled out

- **F1.n1** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E11
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (leak) E11
  - Hypothesis: N-WARM: one-time warm-up fill, not per-frame growth
  - Refuted if: growth continues over the extra cycles and a trim does not flatten it
  - Contradicting evidence: E11
  - Originally supported by: E10

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

None recorded.

### Runtime blind spots

- native: the allocator shim does not record which entry points ran

### Entry points not exercisable

- native: `src/decoder.c::frame_status_name`: no_harness

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E5: partial coverage
- E5: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E5: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E6: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E6: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E7: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E7: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E8: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E8: limitation: 4096 live bytes sit in allocations with no frame in the project (library-internal or without debug info)
- E8: limitation: exercised entry points are not measured for native: the allocator shim sees allocations, not calls
- E9: limitation: 4096 live bytes sit in allocations with no frame in the project (library-internal or without debug info)
- E9: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E10: limitation: 4096 live bytes sit in allocations with no frame in the project (library-internal or without debug info)
- E10: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E11: limitation: 4096 live bytes sit in allocations with no frame in the project (library-internal or without debug info)
- E11: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S2
- E11: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E11: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E12: partial coverage (1 of 3 examined)
- E12: limitation: F1: growth measured as a count; bytes not attributed
- E12: limitation: off-heap: no gap series for S1; run dla gap S1 first (node.external is used when present)
- E12: limitation: threshold is provisional (not calibrated)
