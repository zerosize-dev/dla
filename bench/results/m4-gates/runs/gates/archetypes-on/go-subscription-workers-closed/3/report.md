## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

None recorded.

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

- go: `internal/notify/hub.go::Hub.Opened`: no_harness
- go: `internal/workload/workload.go::NewRNG`: no_harness

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E8: partial coverage
- E8: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E8: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E9: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E9: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E10: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E10: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E10: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E11: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E11: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E12: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E12: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E13: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E13: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E14: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E14: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S2
- E14: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E14: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E14: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E15: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
