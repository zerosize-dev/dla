## Findings

### F1: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(build_fails)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: static/global
- Owner: `billing.InFlightCharges.AWAITING`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/main/java/billing/InFlightCharges.java:8`
- Writers: `src/main/java/billing/InFlightCharges.java:13`, `src/main/java/billing/InFlightCharges.java:14`, `src/main/java/billing/ChargeService.java:27`
- Removers: `src/main/java/billing/InFlightCharges.java:17`, `src/main/java/billing/InFlightCharges.java:18`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Annotation: Static ConcurrentHashMap AWAITING. register() on every charge; complete() is called only from ChargeListener.onPosted. onRejected and onExpired never call complete(), so every declined or expired charge leaves its PendingCharge (with request incl. customerEmail) in the map for the process lifetime. Not exercised: ledger-client is private, build fails offline. Repair class: remove the entry on every terminal callback (rejected/expired), or bound/expire the map.
- Reason: build_fails
- Remedy: Provide access to maven.billing.internal.example (internal.billing:ledger-client:3.2.1) or a stub LedgerClient so the harness can run; then run dla harness gen/run, alloc-test, and confirm F1 with an N-* sibling.
- Supporting evidence: E5

## Ruled out

None.

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- jvm/codeql: missing (codeql is not on PATH or in the tools directory). Install hint: dla install codeql
- jvm/errorprone: missing (Error Prone jars not found in the tools directory (or DLA_ERRORPRONE_HOME)). Install hint: dla install errorprone
- jvm/sonar: missing (sonar-scanner is not installed and Sonar rules need a SonarQube or SonarCloud server). Install hint: install sonar-scanner, run a SonarQube or SonarCloud server and set SONAR_HOST_URL and SONAR_TOKEN (dla install sonar prints the steps)
- jvm/spotbugs: blocked (no class files: run dla probe --build)

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

None recorded.

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E5: partial coverage
- E5: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E5: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
