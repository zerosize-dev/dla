# DLA report

Run: `20261108-200431-7d2d`

Status: COMPLETE

Entry: repository

Scope: repository; excluded: none; out of scope: none

Findings: 4 enumerated, 4 dispositioned; confirmed 1, strong 0, refuted 1, suspected 0, unresolved 2

Residual: not measured

Coverage: go 3520 iterations, 15 of 19 entry points exercised

## Findings

### F2: **Novel mechanism (UNCLASSIFIED)**

- State: confirmed
- Growth: `go.goroutines@internal/notify/subscription.go:33` 1 count/n (steady, gate pass, E14)
- Evidence classes: context, growth, static
- Holder: blocked-stack
- Owner: `internal.notify.subscription.newSubscription -> s.run()`
- Region: non-heap
- Shape: steady
- Site: `internal/notify/subscription.go:33`
- Writers: `internal/notify/subscription.go:33`
- Annotation: go s.run() per Open; Handler.Serve never calls sub.Close()
- Annotation: Handler.Serve (handler.go:20) opens a Subscription per request via Hub.Open; newSubscription starts 'go s.run()' (subscription.go:33) that exits only on Close() via done. Serve never calls sub.Close(), so each request leaks one blocked goroutine (stack + 4KB scratch buffer + channels), explaining both thread/memory growth. Repair class: pair Open with Close (defer) in Serve. Archetype fits none of the labelled ones -> UNCLASSIFIED.
- Sibling hypotheses: F2.n1
- Supporting evidence: E9, E12, E14

### F1: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: unresolved(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: discriminator, static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `internal.notify.render.Renderer.layouts`
- Region: heap
- Site: `internal/notify/render.go:10`
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Renderer.layouts is copied once at NewRenderer and only read afterwards; no writer found. Re-run alloc-test after fixing F2 (Close the subscription) to see whether heap still grows.
- Supporting evidence: E9, E16

### F3: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: unresolved(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: discriminator, static
- Holder: static/global
- Owner: `internal.workload.workload.topics`
- Region: heap
- Site: `internal/workload/workload.go:19`
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: workload.topics is a fixed package slice, never appended to. Re-run alloc-test after fixing F2 to confirm heap plateaus.
- Supporting evidence: E9, E17

## Ruled out

- **F2.n1** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E15
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (leak) E15
  - Hypothesis: N-WARM: goroutine count is warm-up/pool plateau
  - Refuted if: growth continues over the extra cycles
  - Contradicting evidence: E15
  - Originally supported by: E14

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

None recorded.

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

- go: `internal/notify/hub.go::Hub.Opened`: no_harness
- go: `internal/workload/workload.go::NewRNG`: no_harness

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E9: partial coverage
- E9: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E9: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E10: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E10: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E11: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E11: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E11: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E12: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E12: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E13: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E13: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E14: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E14: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E15: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E15: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S2
- E15: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E15: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E15: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E16: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E16: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S4
- E16: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E16: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E16: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E17: limitation: os.* columns are the measured process's own figures: the sampled process tree (wrapper, build and sibling processes) is not mixed in
- E17: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S6
- E17: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E17: limitation: go command mode has no package-variable probes: growth shows in the goroutine groups and runtime totals (use --driver for GoVar probes)
- E17: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
