## Findings

### F5: **Novel mechanism (UNCLASSIFIED)**

- State: confirmed
- Growth: `probe:src/scheduler.js:shared.latest` 25.97 count/n (steady, gate pass, E11)
- Evidence classes: context, growth, static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `src.scheduler.RetryScheduler.latest`
- Region: heap
- Shape: steady
- Site: `src/scheduler.js:15`
- Writers: `src/scheduler.js:32`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Annotation: enqueue() links every attempt record to the prior one via 'previous' and pins the newest in this.latest; nothing ever clears previous/latest, so every record, its job and payload rows stay reachable after delivery or dead-letter, though pending and inflight are empty. Missing pairing: previous is never released when a record is unlinked. recent() needs only a bounded trail. Unlabelled (UNCLASSIFIED).
- Sibling hypotheses: F5.n1
- Supporting evidence: E6, E9, E11

### F1: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: unresolved(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Site: `src/scheduler.js:32`
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Same growth as confirmed F5 (the record chain via latest/previous); no separate cause shown. Re-check after previous/latest is released.
- Supporting evidence: E5

### F2: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: unresolved(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `src.pending.PendingList.head`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/pending.js:7`
- Writers: `src/pending.js:15`, `src/pending.js:24`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Same growth as confirmed F5 (the record chain via latest/previous); no separate cause shown. Re-check after previous/latest is released.
- Supporting evidence: E6

### F3: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: unresolved(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: container-field
- Owner: `src.pending.PendingList.tail`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/pending.js:8`
- Writers: `src/pending.js:16`, `src/pending.js:25`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Same growth as confirmed F5 (the record chain via latest/previous); no separate cause shown. Re-check after previous/latest is released.
- Supporting evidence: E6

### F8: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: unresolved(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: static/global
- Owner: `src.scheduler.shared`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/scheduler.js:90`
- Writers: `src/scheduler.js:93`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Same growth as confirmed F5 (the record chain via latest/previous); no separate cause shown. Re-check after previous/latest is released.
- Supporting evidence: E6

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

None recorded.

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

- node: `src/pending.js::PendingList.[Symbol.iterator]`: no_harness

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E4: partial coverage
- E4: limitation: rxjs-x rules need rxjs to resolve from the project's node_modules for type information
- E6: partial coverage
- E6: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E6: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E7: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E7: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E8: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E8: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E9: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E9: limitation: function coverage is written by node itself to NODE_V8_COVERAGE
