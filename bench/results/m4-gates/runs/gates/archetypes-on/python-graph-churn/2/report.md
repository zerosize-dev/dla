# DLA report

Run: `20261108-195856-efba`

Status: COMPLETE

Entry: repository

Scope: repository; excluded: none; out of scope: none

Findings: 2 enumerated, 2 dispositioned; confirmed 0, strong 0, refuted 1, suspected 0, unresolved 1

Residual: not measured

Coverage: python 3520 iterations, 13 of 13 entry points exercised

## Findings

### F1.n1: Hypothesis N-HEADROOM: Tree/Node parent<->child cycles are reclaimed only by the cyclic GC, which tuning.py delays with threshold 40000 (UNCLASSIFIED)

- State: unresolved(not_exercised)
- Evidence classes: context, discriminator
- Sibling hypothesis of: F1
- Hypothesis: N-HEADROOM: Tree/Node parent<->child cycles are reclaimed only by the cyclic GC, which tuning.py delays with threshold 40000
- Refuted if: growth continues over the extra cycles
- Reason: not_exercised
- Remedy: Sibling N-HEADROOM is supported by E13 (non-leak verdict); verify by setting gc threshold to default and re-running the harness
- Supporting evidence: E13, E10

## Ruled out

- **F1** (UNCLASSIFIED): discriminator E13
  - Ruled out by: plateau+purge (non-leak) E13
  - Contradicting evidence: E13
  - Originally supported by: E7, E10

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- python/codeql: missing (codeql is not on PATH or in the tools directory). Install hint: dla install codeql

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

None recorded.

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E7: partial coverage
- E7: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E7: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
- E8: limitation: entry points are matched to workloads by identifier name in the workload's own source files and, for up to two hops, in the bodies of the entry points reached; this is a name match, not a call graph
- E8: limitation: workloads were discovered by reading files; none was run
- E9: limitation: harness written; nothing was run (dla harness run measures it)
- E9: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E10: partial coverage (9 of 9 examined)
- E10: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E11: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E11: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E12: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E12: limitation: gate thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
- E13: limitation: py.traced counts only allocations made after tracemalloc started (interpreter start-up excluded)
- E13: limitation: points 1 to 9 come from S1; the extra points from S2
- E13: limitation: scratch copy: 23 path(s) not copied (not a regular file)
- E13: limitation: gate and plateau thresholds are provisional (not calibrated)
