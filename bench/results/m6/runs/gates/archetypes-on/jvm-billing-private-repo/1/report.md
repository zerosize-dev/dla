# DLA report

Run: `20261110-162801-51c0`

Status: COMPLETE

Entry: repository

Scope: repository; excluded: none; out of scope: none

Findings: 1 enumerated, 1 dispositioned; confirmed 0, strong 0, refuted 0, suspected 1, unresolved 0

Residual: not measured

Coverage: not measured

## Findings

### F1: **UNCLASSIFIED**

- State: suspected_static_only(build_fails)
- Evidence classes: static
- Holder: static/global
- Owner: `billing.InFlightCharges.AWAITING`
- Region: heap
- Site: `src/main/java/billing/InFlightCharges.java:8`
- Writers: `src/main/java/billing/InFlightCharges.java:13`
- Removers: `src/main/java/billing/InFlightCharges.java:17`
- Annotation: heuristic name match over the project's sources
- Reason: build_fails
- Remedy: internal.billing:ledger-client:3.2.1 is not resolvable (private repo, only a .lastUpdated stub in ~/.m2); provide the jar or access to maven.billing.internal.example, then run dla harness over Main, or attach to the live gateway (dla sample/attach jcmd GC.class_histogram) to show InFlightCharges.AWAITING growing
- Supporting evidence: E5

## Ruled out

None.

## Blind spots and unknowns

### Coverage gaps

- jvm/bcc-memleak: blocked (bcc memleak is not driven by DLA in this version; `dla attach bpftrace` counts mapped bytes per call stack (tier 3, root))
- jvm/codeql: missing (codeql is not on PATH or in the tools directory). Install hint: dla install codeql
- jvm/errorprone: missing (Error Prone jars not found in the tools directory (or DLA_ERRORPRONE_HOME)). Install hint: dla install errorprone
- jvm/gpu-nvml: blocked (GPU memory (NVML, nvidia-smi) is not read by DLA in this version: device memory growth is a blind spot)
- jvm/sonar: missing (sonar-scanner is not installed and Sonar rules need a SonarQube or SonarCloud server). Install hint: install sonar-scanner, run a SonarQube or SonarCloud server and set SONAR_HOST_URL and SONAR_TOKEN (dla install sonar prints the steps)
- jvm/spotbugs: blocked (no class files: run dla probe --build)
- jvm/valgrind: blocked (Valgrind is not run on the JVM: the virtual machine's own allocations drown the project's; use the allocator shim, jcmd NMT or `dla attach bpftrace`)

### Runtime blind spots

None recorded.

### Entry points not exercisable

None recorded.

### Evidence limitations and unknowns

- E5: partial coverage
- E5: limitation: declaration patterns only: holders created through reflection, generated code or dependencies are not listed
- E5: limitation: writers and removers are textual name matches
